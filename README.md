# live-me-up
Live me up is a venue discovery platform with the additional feature of being able to listen to the songs produced by the artist you are searching for.

***

## Description
Live me up takes venue discovery apps one step further. Not only can you discover where your favourite artists are playing and book tickets, you can also listen to some of their songs from a selected album (chosen by Deezer). A simple search can help you (the user) find exactly where that artist is playing and help you explore their catalogue of music before you go!

### Features

* Venue discovery: Find where your favourite artist is playing and buy tickets (powered by Bands In Town API).
* Music discovery: Listen to songs from one of their top albums (powered by Deezer API).
* Search history: Quickly rediscover who you have previosly searched for by starting another search.
* Auto-scroll upon search: Save time scrolling. Once you hit search you will be taken directly down to the venue locations.
